# Example of BAdI IDOC_DATA_MAPPER implementation

[IDoc](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_AS_ABAP_751_IP/8f3819b0c24149b5959ab31070b64058/4ab074b6aa3a1997e10000000a421937.html?locale=en-US) is the abbreviation for "Intermediate Documents", a widley used standard to exchange business data between systems, mostly SAP Software based systems. With an implementation of the classic Business Add-in (BAdI) IDOC_DATA_MAPPER, you can change values in inbound and outbound IDocs via ABAP programming. 

How to do that is the topic of this repository. It contains a small, not syntax checked example as reminder. Please check also this [SAP Community Blog](community.sap.com) for more detailed tips, hints and tricks.
